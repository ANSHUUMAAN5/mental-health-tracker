Mental Health Tracker - Design Document
1. Overall Architecture Diagram
Description:
The architecture consists of:
• Frontend: Built with React.js (or React Native for mobile)
• Backend: Flask/Django (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
• Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite
• Machine Learning (Sentiment Analysis): TextBlob / VADER / Hugging Face 
Transformers
• Notifications & Authentication: Firebase for push notifications, JWT for secure user 
login
Diagram:
(A diagram here will show connections between frontend, backend, database, ML, and 
authentication systems.)
2. Use-Case Diagram
Description:
Shows interactions between users and the system:
• Users log their mood.
• Users write journal entries.
• The system analyzes sentiment.
• The system provides insights & reminders.
• Users access mental health resources.
